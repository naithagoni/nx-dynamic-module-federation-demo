## Scope of the project

This project explains how to create micro-frontends with dynamic module federation using NX, a set of tools for building monorepo-style projects. The approach allows for the creation of independent, scalable front-end modules that can be combined to create a larger application. Furthermore, this project also explains how you can create an NX user library and import it into the host or remote app.

1. `git clone` [nx-dynamic-module-federation-demo](https://github.com/naithagoni/nx-dynamic-module-federation-demo.git).
