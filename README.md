## Scope of the project

This project explains how to create micro-frontends with dynamic module federation using NX, a set of tools for building monorepo-style projects. The approach allows for the creation of independent, scalable front-end modules that can be combined to create a larger application. Furthermore, this project also explains how you can create an NX user library and import it into the host or remote app.

## Install the project

1. `git clone` [nx-dynamic-module-federation-demo](https://github.com/naithagoni/nx-dynamic-module-federation-demo.git).
2. `npm i`
3. `npm run watch`

## Further Improvements

#### Establish communicattion:
- In a Micro Frontends architecture using Module Federation, communication between the host(container) (_dashboard_) and a remote (_product_) can be established in several ways:.
  1. **Shared Angular Services:** - If both apps are Angular-based, create a shared Angular service in a library. Use Angular's dependency injection mechanism to provide and use these services across both host and remote apps.
  2. **State Management Libraries(Global store):** - Use state management libraries like NgRx, Redux, or Zustand to manage a shared state. This can be combined with Module Federation's shares to ensure a single state management instance.
  3. **Web Components:**
  4. **Module Federation Exposes and Shares:** - The host and remote apps can correctly expose and share modules, components, or services as needed. You can expose certain services or components from a 'product' app that the host app(_dashboard_) can dynamically load and use.
